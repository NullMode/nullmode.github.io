I have developed a collection of scripts and tools that are all available via my [GitHub](https://github.com/NullMode/vim) profile. Go check them out :)

### Vim Profile

I have pimped out my vim config quite a bit and created an installer and updater for Linux/OSX. It contains plugins for Python and Git amongst over things.

### Password Cracking Utils

A collection of simple scripts that I knocked up to help me with password cracking. Nothing fancy in here, but they might be useful to someone.

### PuTTYExtractor
One day I thought it might be nice to extract my PuTTY configuration from the registry on windows and convert it into ssh commands that could be run via a command line. PuTTYExtractor does just that.

<TODO show example>

### Spelling With Say

Yeah this really isn't that useful, but i'll mention it anyway (until I have too many tools on this page and need to get rid of one). Spelling with say is a very very very simple wrapper around the `say` command line utility on OSX. I was bored one evening so I knocked up a script that aid in spelling if you wanted to learn from the command line. I didn't use it after I made it.
